STEP 1: 
  From the root directory of this project, run 
  ```bash 
  $./confgen.hs
  $./bar
  ``` 
  The first command set up the databrary.conf file
  The script that followed set up the postgresql server along with required schemas

STEP 2:
  From the same root directory of this project, run 
  ```bash
  $nix-shell
  $cabal repl databrary
  ```

STEP 3: 
  When cabal successfully builds all 303 dependencies, run 
  ```bash
  $main
  ```
Note: In order to clean your database & cabal test environment, it is best to
execute the following commands in this order: 
```bash
$dropdb databrary
$dropuser databrary
$pg_ctl -D databrary-db -l logfile stop
$rm -rf databrary-db/
$rm -rf dist/
